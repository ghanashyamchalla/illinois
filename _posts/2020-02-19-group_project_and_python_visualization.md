### Group Project

From Josh Vita:

> We're planning to try to do a semester-long (or more?) software project together. It could be a simple app or game, or maybe even a small research project? Anything that you think would be a fun way to explore programming topics that you're interested in (visualization, machine learning, optimization, front-end development, etc.) would be good. Our first project planning meeting will be next week, so try to brainstorm some ideas of what you'd like to make!
