## Spring '20 Planning

There has been a lot of interest in THW at Illinois but we need to continue to provide the resources students want to help them excel!

Questions to think about:

- What **has** and **hasn't** worked?
- What topics should be covered?
	- Is there interest in long-term learning?
	- What kind of professional development would be helpful?
		- resume, cover letter, presentation templates?
- THW Slack?
- Paper-writing tools? (Mendeley, Zenodo, other citation managers, etc.)
- [HAL Spring 2020 training and hackathons](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/data/deep_learning/news/hal_spring20)?

(I borrowed from [Spring '16 Planning post](Spring-16-Planning))
